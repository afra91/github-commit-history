## Development

#### Quick Start

Run the following commands to get it up and running:

```bash
npm install
npm run start-frontend
```

The last command serves the frontend from parcel's built-in development server.  
You can run the following commands in case you want to serve it from a express server:

```bash
npm run watch-frontend
npm run start-server
```
